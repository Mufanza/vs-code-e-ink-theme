# E-Ink Theme for Visual Studio Code

E-Ink is a purely black-and-white color theme designed to look and feel good on E-Ink monitors (such as Dasung Paperlike http://www.dasungtech.com/).

Based on Anchorage, the theme distinguishes between (mostly) javascript keywords by marking them in bold font. Comments are displayed in greyed-out font whilte the contrast between regural text and background has been cranked-up to maximum in order to work nicely with the e-ink medium.

## Installation

In the command palette (`ctrl/cmd + shift + p`) type Install Extension and search for E-Ink.
