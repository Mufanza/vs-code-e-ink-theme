# E-Ink Theme for Visual Studio Code
A light Visual Studio Code color theme optimized for usage with black-and-white E-Ink monitors

This is a purely black-and-white color theme designed to look and feel good on E-Ink monitors (such as Dasung Paperlike http://www.dasungtech.com/).

The theme distinguishes between (mostly) javascript keywords by marking them in bold font. Comments are displayed in greyed-out font while the contrast between regural text and background has been cranked-up to maximum in order to work nicely with the e-ink medium.

## Installation

In the command palette (`ctrl/cmd + shift + p`) type Install Extension and search for **E-Ink 2**.

## Example

## Notes
I recommend you use this along with the amazing [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) font.
